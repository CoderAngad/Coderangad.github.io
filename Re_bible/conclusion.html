        <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 20px; margin: 2rem;">The story teaches us several important lessons about how we should treat others. First, it shows us that we should not judge people by their appearance, ethnicity or religion, but by their actions and character. The Samaritan was not expected to help the man, but he did so out of kindness and generosity. He did not care about the differences between them, but only about the suffering of another human being. Second, it shows us that we should not limit our love to those who are close to us or who share our beliefs, but extend it to anyone who needs it. The Samaritan did not know the man, but he treated him as his neighbor and friend. He did not ask for anything in return, but gave freely and generously. Third, it shows us that we should not be indifferent or apathetic to the problems of others, but be willing to act and help. The Samaritan did not ignore the man or leave him to his fate, but he took responsibility and initiative to help him. He did not just offer words or prayers, but practical and concrete assistance.
            
            In my opinion, the parable of the Good Samaritan is a powerful and inspiring example of how we should live as human beings. It challenges us to overcome our prejudices and biases, to expand our circle of compassion and empathy, and to be active and responsible in making a positive difference in the world. It reminds us that we are all connected and interdependent, and that we have a duty to love God and our neighbor as ourselves.</p>
