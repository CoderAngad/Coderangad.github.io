                What is it?

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The story begins with a lawyer asking Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus asks him to summarize the law of Moses, and the lawyer replies with two commandments: to love God with all one's being and to love one's neighbor as oneself. Jesus commends him for his answer, but the lawyer wants to justify himself and asks Jesus who his neighbor is.

                Jesus then tells the story of a man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho, a dangerous road where robbers often attacked travelers. The man fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and left him half-dead on the roadside. A priest came by and saw the man, but he passed by on the other side, avoiding him. Likewise, a Levite, who was a temple assistant, came by and saw the man, but he also passed by on the other side. Finally, a Samaritan came by and saw the man. Samaritans were despised by Jews as foreigners and heretics, but this Samaritan had compassion on the man. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He then put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he cared for him. The next day, he gave the innkeeper some money and asked him to look after the man until he returned. He promised to pay any extra expenses that might arise.
                
                Jesus then asked the lawyer which of the three travelers was a neighbor to the man who was robbed. The lawyer answered that it was the one who showed mercy. Jesus told him to go and do likewise.</p>
