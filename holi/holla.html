        <h1>Hola Mohalla</h1>
        <p>Hola Mohalla, also called Hola, is a three-day long Sikh festival which normally falls in March and takes place on the second day of the lunar month of Chett, a day after the Hindu spring festival Holi but sometimes coincides with Holi. Hola Mohalla is a big festive event for Sikhs around the world.

            The fair held during Holi and Hola at Anandpur Sahib is traditionally a three-day event but participants attend Anandpur Sahib for a week, camping out and enjoying various displays of fighting prowess and bravery, and listening to kirtan, music and poetry. For meals, which is an integral part of the Sikh institution (Gurdwara), visitors sit together in Pangats (Rows) and eat vegetarian (No eggs either) food of the Langars. The event concludes on the day of Hola Mohalla with a long, "military-style" procession near Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib, one of the five seats of temporal authority of the Sikhs.</p>

            <h1>Etymology</h1>
            
            <p>Bhai Kahan Singh, who compiled the Mahan Kosh (the first Sikh encyclopedia) at the turn of the 20th century, explained, "Hola is derived from the word halla (a military charge) and the term mohalla stands for an organized procession or an army column. The words 'Hola Mohalla' would thus mean 'the charge of an army.' " Dr. M.S. Ahluwalia notes that the related Punjabi term mahalia (which was derived from the root hal, meaning to alight or descend) refers to "an organized procession in the form of an army column accompanied by war drums and standard-bearers, and proceeding to a given location or moving in state from one to another."
                
                Hola is a Sanskrit word meant to be distinguished from Holi, the Hindu spring festival of colors (Holi) which takes place the day before Hola Mohalla.</p>



                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Hola Mohalla builds upon the Spring festival of Holi. The Guru Granth Sahib contains passages prescribing the celebration of Holi by serving God. The colours of Holi manifest in the Lord's love. As Holi starts with Holika Dahan on the full moon night of Phagan or Phalgan, the festival of Holi is referred to as the festival of Phalgun even though the actual day of Holi falls on the first day of the lunar month of Chett. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji built upon this method of celebrating Holi by adding a martial element and creating Hola Mohalla to be celebrated a day after Holi.

                    The festival also has roots in the story of the child bhagat, Prahlad who would not accept his father, Harnakash, as god. According to Gandhi (2007), "in order to please her brother, Holka planned to burn Prahlad. She took him in her lap, sat in the midst of a heap of easily combustible straw". Holka thought she would be protected by a cloth but it was Prahald who survived and Holka perished in the fire. The event gave rise to the belief that good triumphed over evil. Harnaksh, the King of Multan, was defeated by good in the form of Prahlad. According to Lorenzen(1996), the story of Prahlad was popular with the early Sikhs. The Guru Granth contains verses reciting Prahald by the saints Namdev and Kabir, and also by the third Guru Amar Das.</p>
