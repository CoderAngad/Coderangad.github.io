                    Spider-Man is a famous and beloved superhero who has appeared in various forms of media since his creation in 1962. He is the alter ego of Peter Parker, a smart and shy teenager who lives with his Aunt May in Queens, New York. Peter was orphaned at a young age when his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, were killed in a mysterious plane crash. He was then raised by his uncle Ben and aunt May, who taught him the values of responsibility and compassion.<br>
                    
                    Spider-Man's origin story begins when Peter attends a science exhibition at a local university, where he is accidentally bitten by a spider that had been exposed to radiation. The bite gives him incredible powers that mimic those of a spider, such as superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, and balance. He can also stick to walls and ceilings with his hands and feet, shoot webs from devices that he invented and attached to his wrists, and sense impending danger with his sixth sense called spider-sense.<br>
                    
                    At first, Peter uses his powers for selfish purposes, such as making money by wrestling and entertaining crowds. However, he learns a hard lesson when his uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar that Peter had the chance to stop earlier but didn't. Peter realizes that he has a moral obligation to use his powers for good, and adopts the motto "With great power comes great responsibility", which he attributes to his uncle Ben. He then decides to become a superhero and calls himself Spider-Man.<br>
                    
                    Spider-Man faces many challenges and enemies as he tries to balance his superhero life with his personal life. He works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle newspaper, where he is constantly harassed by his boss J. Jonah Jameson, who hates Spider-Man and tries to ruin his reputation. He also has many friends and allies, such as Harry Osborn, Flash Thompson, Black Cat, and other superheroes like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. He falls in love with several women, most notably Gwen Stacy, who dies tragically at the hands of the Green Goblin, and Mary Jane Watson, who becomes his wife in some versions of the story.<br>
                    
                    Spider-Man is a hero who represents the ideals of responsibility, courage, loyalty, and compassion. He follows the motto "With great power comes great responsibility", which he learned from his uncle Ben. He often faces challenges and dilemmas that test his morals and values. He is not perfect and makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing and help others.<br>
                    
                    Spider-Man has been adapted into various media forms over the years. He has starred in several animated and live-action TV shows, movies, video games, novels, plays, and musicals. Some of the most famous actors who have portrayed him are Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Tom Holland, and Shameik Moore. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential comic book characters of all time.</p>
